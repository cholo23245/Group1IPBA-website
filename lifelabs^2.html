      <h3>
        Kass: My thought is making a paper prototype and the topic of the prototype is all about raising awareness to social Media… </h3>
        <h3>Example: I'm bored so I open my phone and go to Instagram…. While i was scrolling i see a post that they humiliating a boy and transgender that they show love towards each other and i saw many comment that  they are against their love…,
        </h3>
        <h3>Sam: My thoughts for our prototype was to make a paper prototype and it's all about a raising awareness about gender inequality that were protested by people who are against to it
        </h3>
        <h3>In my own opinion, we should speak up against people and support each other equally without protesting, humiliation or haters. Educate people and raise awareness by posting on social media and encouraging people to take action to it.

            Matt: My thoughts for our prototype is making a paper prototype and raising awareness to social media like: IG, TT, and X and to raise awareness to the young people to be aware of what they are doing online.

            <h3>
                Vien: I think making a paper prototype for spreading awareness about gender inequality is all right, this can be effective in reaching diverse audiences.  Making the prototype a paper prototype can be accessible to people who might not have digital platforms, and maybe  people interacting with the materials will get them to be more engaged with the information we’re trying to convey. Spreading awareness about gender inequality is important because by that we can get a more unprejudiced society, deconstructing damaging preconceptions and give people the power to actively participate in good change.

                <h3>Chollo: It's deeply concerning that such hateful comments are being made and that the couple is facing humiliation because of their sexuality. We must raise awareness about the rights and dignity of LGBTQ+ individuals, and stand up against discrimination, homophobia, and transphobia in all forms. It's important to take a firm stance against bullying, hatred, and violence towards any group of people, regardless of their gender or sexual orientation.
                </h3>
                <h3>
                    We must educate ourselves and others about the importance of inclusivity, respect, and empathy in building a society where all individuals are valued and celebrated. It's essential to be an ally to the LGBTQ+ community and to use our voices to speak out against injustice and oppression. We must continue to work towards a world where everyone can live freely and truly be themselves without fear or discrimination.
