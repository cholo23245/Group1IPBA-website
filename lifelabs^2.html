      <h3>
        Kass: My thought is making a paper prototype and the topic of the prototype is all about raising awareness to social Media… </h3>
        <h3>Example: I'm bored so I open my phone and go to Instagram…. While i was scrolling i see a post that they humiliating a boy and transgender that they show love towards each other and i saw many comment that  they are against their love…,
        </h3>
        <h3>Sam: My thoughts for our prototype was to make a paper prototype and it's all about a raising awareness about gender inequality that were protested by people who are against to it
        </h3>
        <h3>In my own opinion, we should speak up against people and support each other equally without protesting, humiliation or haters. Educate people and raise awareness by posting on social media and encouraging people to take action to it.
        </h3>
        <h3>
            Matt: My thoughts for our prototype is making a paper prototype and raising awareness to social media like: IG, TT, and X and to raise awareness to the young people to be aware of what they are doing online.
            </h3>
            <h3>
                Vien: I think making a paper prototype for spreading awareness about gender inequality is all right, this can be effective in reaching diverse audiences.  Making the prototype a paper prototype can be accessible to people who might not have digital platforms, and maybe  people interacting with the materials will get them to be more engaged with the information we’re trying to convey. Spreading awareness about gender inequality is important because by that we can get a more unprejudiced society, deconstructing damaging preconceptions and give people the power to actively participate in good change.
                </h3>
                <h3>Chollo: It's deeply concerning that such hateful comments are being made and that the couple is facing humiliation because of their sexuality. We must raise awareness about the rights and dignity of LGBTQ+ individuals, and stand up against discrimination, homophobia, and transphobia in all forms. It's important to take a firm stance against bullying, hatred, and violence towards any group of people, regardless of their gender or sexual orientation.
                </h3>
                <h3>
                    We must educate ourselves and others about the importance of inclusivity, respect, and empathy in building a society where all individuals are valued and celebrated. It's essential to be an ally to the LGBTQ+ community and to use our voices to speak out against injustice and oppression. We must continue to work towards a world where everyone can live freely and truly be themselves without fear or discrimination.

                    <H3>Kass: We can make 10 questions on a usability test and we can insert our solution on it and we can ask our audiences if they agree or disagree with our solution.. And to better understand we can describe what gender inequality is..</H3>
                    <h3>Vivienne: Our questions in the usability test must be related to our problem or the topic we are trying to address, so that we will be able to get answers that can help our product to improve and to get better results.</h3>
                    <h3>Samantha: Our Usability Test Questions are related to gender inequality, we will be asking proper questions that are related to our topic and we are expecting to receive an answer from our audiences and with that, we will be able to get a better understanding about gender inequality and improve more.
                    </h3>
                    <h3>Chollo:  Based on the information provided, here are my thoughts and opinions on usability testing:

                        * Usability testing is a critical step in the design process, as it allows designers to test the user experience of a product or service and identify areas for improvement.
                        * It is an important tool for gathering feedback from target users and understanding how they interact with a design, which can help designers make informed decisions about design improvements.
                        * When conducting usability testing, it is important to choose a representative sample of users and conduct a variety of tests to gather a comprehensive understanding of their experiences and needs.
                        * It is also important to keep an open mind and listen to the feedback provided by the users, even if it may be negative or challenging to hear. By addressing the issues identified in usability testing, designers can create stronger, more user-friendly designs.
                        * Usability testing can be conducted in a variety of ways, including live usability testing, usability surveys, and diary studies. Each method has its own benefits and drawbacks, and designers need to choose the method that best fits their needs and budget.
                        * Finally, usability testing is just one step in the design process, and it needs to be followed by other steps such as evaluation and analysis of the results, and iteration of the design based on insights gained from the testing.

                        <h3>Mathew: We can raise awareness and we can teach them what is gender inequality by our usability testing and make them more know what is gender inequality etc.</h3>
                        <h3>Madrid: It can be an effective way of letting the audience give feedback about our solution, giving us ideas of what our usability tests are lacking and can improve it to make it more efficient.
